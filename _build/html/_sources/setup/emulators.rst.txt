Emulator Set-Up
===========================================================

Here are a quick guide to set up different emulators to have the best modding experience.

Project64
-------------

The most-used Nintendo 64 emulator and, very probably, the one that will be used the most by the users of your mod.
You can download it here: `https://www.pj64-emu.com/ <https://www.pj64-emu.com/>`_

**SETUP**

   **1.- ROM directory**
      Go to File in the upper-left section of the emulator and select "**Choose ROM Directory...**"

      It will open a new window where you can select an specific folder in the system. It will then use that path as the main ROM directory and it will show in the main page all the ROMS that are in that path.

   **2.- Configuration**
      Go to Options -> Configuration or press ``Ctrl+P`` to open the configuration window

      **1.- Enable Advanced settings**
         In the main settings section **"General settings"** un select the checkbox **Hide advanced settings**

      **2.- Defaults**
         Go to the **Defaults** section and set the **Memory size** to **8MB**

|

      **3.- Advanced**
         Go to the **Advanced** section and enable **Always use interpreter core**

         .. note::
            This will avoid an error related to the way Project64 recompiles code when oppening your modded OOT ROM

      **4.- Plugins**
         Go to the **Plugins** section, copy the image configuration and click in **OK**

         .. image:: ../images/setup/emulators/p64_config_plugins.png

|

   **3.- Graphic Settings**
      Go to Options -> Graphic Settings and jump to the **OSD** section in the top of the window

      Copy the configuration in the image and then click in **Save and close** at the bottom of the window

|

   **4.- Input Settings**
      Go to Options -> Input Settings and jump to the **Player2** section in the top of the window

      Click on **Controller is plugged in** to simulate a second controller

      .. note::
         In order to have access to the OOT debug features, a second controller must be plugged in. It was a security check back in the day
